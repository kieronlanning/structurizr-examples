# 3. Firewall Rules and Policies

Date: 2024-07-30

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Effective firewall management requires well-defined rules and policies to determine what traffic is allowed or denied. These rules need to be aligned with the platform's security requirements and business operations.

## Decision

The firewall will be configured with a set of baseline rules, including:

- Blocking all incoming traffic by default, except for whitelisted services.
- Allowing outbound traffic only from trusted sources and services.
- Implementing intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS) to monitor and block suspicious activities.

## Consequences

- **Positive:** Increased control over network traffic, reduced risk of security breaches.
- **Negative:** Possible disruption of legitimate services if rules are too restrictive, requires regular updates and monitoring.
