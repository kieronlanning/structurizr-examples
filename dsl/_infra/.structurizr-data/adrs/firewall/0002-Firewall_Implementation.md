# 2. Firewall Implementation

Date: 2024-07-30

## Status

Accepted

## Context

To protect the pie-making platform's network from unauthorized access and cyber threats, a robust firewall solution is needed. This solution should control and monitor incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.

## Decision

The platform will implement a firewall solution at both the network perimeter and within internal segments. This will include a combination of traditional hardware firewalls and software-based firewalls to ensure comprehensive protection.

## Consequences

- **Positive:** Enhanced network security, prevention of unauthorized access, and protection against external threats.
- **Negative:** Potential performance impact, increased complexity in network management.
