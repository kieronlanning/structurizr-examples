Date: 2024-07-01

## Status

Superseded by 0002

## Context

The initial design of the pie-making platform considered basic firewall protection, primarily focused on preventing unauthorized external access.

## Decision

A basic hardware firewall was implemented at the network perimeter to block unsolicited inbound connections, while allowing outbound traffic by default.

## Consequences

- **Positive:** Basic level of security, easy implementation.
- **Negative:** Limited protection, no internal network segmentation or detailed traffic control.
